## Words and keywords
    
### Words: - 
Words in JavaScript are the identifiers, variables, function names, and other symbols that you, the programmer, create or use in your code. These words are essential for writing meaningful and functional code, and they must adhere to specific naming rules to be valid in JavaScript. (In simpler terms, words are any terms you create that do not have predefined meanings in JavaScript.)
## Keyword : -
Keywords are reserved words in JavaScript that have special meanings and purposes within the language. They are part of the language's syntax and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). (In simpler terms, keywords are words that have built-in meanings in JavaScript.)

# What are Variables?
Think of variables as containers that store data. `In JavaScript, you use variables to hold different kinds of information, such as numbers, text (strings), true or false values (Booleans), and more. ` 

## How to declare variables?

    In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the `let`, `const`, and `var` keywords.

    - `let` is used for variables that can be reassigned.
    - `const` is used for variables that cannot be reassigned.
    - `var` is used for variables that can be reassigned.

See [Variables.js](./Variables.js) for more details and examples with code.
